# Quantum Simulation

HaskQ includes a powerful quantum circuit simulator that allows you to test and analyze quantum algorithms without a physical quantum computer. This document explains how simulation works in HaskQ and how to use it effectively.

## Getting Started with HaskQ Simulator

### Installation

To use the HaskQ simulator, first ensure you have the HaskQ package installed:

```bash
# Install HaskQ from source
git clone https://github.com/haskq/haskq.git
cd haskq
cabal install

# Or using stack
stack install
```

Once installed, you'll have access to the command-line simulator `haskq-sim` and the simulator library for use in your Haskell programs.

### Quick Start Example

Create a file named `BellState.hs` with the following content:

```haskell
import HaskQ.Prelude
import HaskQ.Simulator.Circuit (simulateCircuit)

main :: IO ()
main = do
  let result = simulateCircuit 2 $ do
        (q1, q2) <- bellState
        (m1, _) <- measure q1
        (m2, _) <- measure q2
        pure [m1, m2]
  
  putStrLn $ "Measurement results: " ++ show (measurements result)
```

Compile and run:

```bash
ghc -o bell-state BellState.hs
./bell-state
```

You should see either `[Zero, Zero]` or `[One, One]` as the output, demonstrating quantum entanglement.

## The HaskQ Simulator

The HaskQ simulator is a state vector simulator that tracks the full quantum state through circuit execution. It's implemented in the `haskq-simulator` package, which provides:

1. State vector representation of quantum states
2. Matrix-based implementation of quantum gates
3. Efficient simulation algorithms
4. Visualization tools for circuits and results
5. Command-line interface for quick simulations

## Simulation Basics

### The State Vector Representation

In HaskQ, quantum states are represented by state vectors:

```haskell
-- State vector for an n-qubit system
data StateVector = StateVector
  { numQubits :: Int
  , amplitudes :: Vector (Complex Double)
  }
```

For an n-qubit system, the state vector contains 2^n complex amplitudes representing the probability amplitudes of each basis state.

### Creating and Initializing States

```haskell
-- Initialize a simulation state for n qubits
initializeState :: Int -> SimState
initializeState n = SimState
  { stateVector = createStateVector n
  , qubits = [0..(n-1)]
  , measurements = []
  }
```

By default, qubits are initialized in the |0⟩ state.

## Running Simulations

HaskQ provides several ways to simulate quantum circuits:

### Basic Circuit Simulation

```haskell
-- Simulate a circuit and get the output
simulateCircuit :: Int -> Circ a %1-> CircuitOutput a
simulateCircuit numQubits circ = ...
```

This function:
1. Takes the number of qubits and a quantum circuit
2. Simulates the circuit execution
3. Returns the measurement results and the circuit's output value

### Example Usage

```haskell
-- Import the required modules
import HaskQ.Prelude
import HaskQ.Simulator.Circuit (simulateCircuit)
import qualified Prelude as P

-- Simulate a bell state creation and measurement
simulateBell :: IO ()
simulateBell = do
  let result = simulateCircuit 2 $ do
        -- Create bell state
        (q1, q2) <- bellState
        -- Measure both qubits
        (m1, q1') <- measure q1
        (m2, q2') <- measure q2
        pure [m1, m2]
        
  P.putStrLn $ "Measurements: " ++ P.show (measurements result)
  
main :: IO ()
main = simulateBell
```

## Simulation Results and Analysis

The `CircuitOutput` type contains the results of a simulation:

```haskell
data CircuitOutput a = CircuitOutput
  { measurements :: [Measurement]
  , result :: a
  }
```

### Analyzing Measurement Probabilities

```haskell
import HaskQ.Prelude
import HaskQ.Simulator.Circuit (simulateCircuit)
import qualified Prelude as P
import Data.List (group, sort)

-- Calculate probability distribution of measurement outcomes
getProbabilities :: [Measurement] -> [(String, Double)]
getProbabilities results = 
  let total = P.fromIntegral $ P.length results
      grouped = group $ sort $ P.map P.show results
      counts = P.map (\g -> (P.head g, P.fromIntegral $ P.length g)) grouped
  in P.map (\(outcome, count) -> (outcome, count / total)) counts

-- Example: Run multiple simulations and analyze results
analyzeResults :: IO ()
analyzeResults = do
  let numRuns = 1000
      results = P.map measurements $ P.replicate numRuns $ 
                simulateCircuit 2 $ do
                  (q1, q2) <- bellState
                  (m1, _) <- measure q1
                  (m2, _) <- measure q2
                  pure [m1, m2]
                  
      -- Flatten all measurement results
      allMeasurements = P.concat results
      probs = getProbabilities allMeasurements
      
  P.forM_ probs $ \(outcome, prob) ->
    P.putStrLn $ outcome ++ ": " ++ P.show (prob * 100) ++ "%"
```

## Visualizing Circuits

HaskQ provides tools to visualize quantum circuits:

```haskell
import HaskQ.Prelude
import HaskQ.Simulator.Visualizer (visualizeCircuit, circuitToAscii)
import qualified Data.Text.IO as TIO

-- Define a circuit
myCircuit :: Circ [Measurement]
myCircuit = do
  (q1, q2) <- bellState
  (m1, q1') <- measure q1
  (m2, q2') <- measure q2
  pure [m1, m2]

-- Visualize and display the circuit
visualizeMyCircuit :: IO ()
visualizeMyCircuit = do
  let vis = visualizeCircuit myCircuit
  TIO.putStrLn $ circuitToAscii vis
```

### Example Visualization

```
Bell State Circuit:

0: --H--●--M--
       |
1: -----X--M--
```

## The Command-Line Simulator

HaskQ includes command-line tools for quick simulations:

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Simulate a Bell state circuit and output in ASCII format
haskq-sim --circuit bell --output ascii

# Simulate a GHZ state with 3 qubits
haskq-sim --circuit ghz --qubits 3 --output ascii

# Save the circuit visualization to a file
haskq-sim --circuit teleport --output json --file teleport.json
```

### Available Options

- `--circuit` or `-c`: Circuit to simulate (bell, ghz, teleport, deutsch)
- `--qubits` or `-q`: Number of qubits (default: 2)
- `--output` or `-o`: Output format (ascii or json, default: ascii)
- `--file` or `-f`: Output file (optional, defaults to stdout)

### Error Correction Examples

HaskQ includes specialized executable for error correction simulations:

```bash
# Run the bit-flip error correction example
haskq-error-correction bit-flip

# Run the phase-flip error correction example
haskq-error-correction phase-flip
```

## Advanced Simulation Features

HaskQ's simulator includes several advanced features:

### Parameterized Circuits

You can create parameterized circuits where gate parameters are determined at runtime:

```haskell
-- A circuit with a parameterized rotation
rotationCircuit :: Double -> Circ Qubit
rotationCircuit theta = do
  q <- createQubit Zero
  rotateX theta q
```

### Controlled Randomness

For probabilistic simulations, HaskQ allows controlled randomness using a seed:

```haskell
import HaskQ.Simulator.Circuit (simulateCircuitWithSeed)

-- Run the same simulation with a fixed seed
deterministicSim :: IO ()
deterministicSim = do
  let seed = 42
      result = simulateCircuitWithSeed seed 2 $ do
        q <- createQubit Zero
        q' <- hadamard q
        (m, _) <- measure q'
        pure m
        
  putStrLn $ "Result: " ++ show (result)
```

### Batch Simulation

For Monte Carlo simulations, you can run multiple simulations in batch:

```haskell
import HaskQ.Simulator.Circuit (batchSimulateCircuit)

-- Run the same circuit 1000 times
batchSim :: IO ()
batchSim = do
  let numRuns = 1000
      results = batchSimulateCircuit numRuns 1 $ do
        q <- createQubit Zero
        q' <- hadamard q
        (m, _) <- measure q'
        pure m
        
  putStrLn $ "Zero count: " ++ show (count Zero results)
  putStrLn $ "One count: " ++ show (count One results)
  where
    count x = length . filter (== x)
```

## Maximizing Simulation Efficiency

HaskQ's simulator is optimized for performance, but simulating large quantum systems remains challenging. Here are tips for maximizing efficiency:

### Memory Management

- The memory requirements grow exponentially with the number of qubits
- For n qubits, the state vector requires 2^n complex numbers

### Simulation Limits

- Practical limits on standard hardware: 25-30 qubits
- Simulating specialized circuits can push this boundary higher
- Consider specialized simulation techniques for larger systems

### Performance Tips

1. Use garbage collection when possible to release unused qubits
2. Avoid unnecessary measurements which collapse superpositions
3. Use batch simulations for repeated runs
4. For large circuits, consider breaking them into smaller subcircuits

## Limitations of Classical Simulation

It's important to understand the limitations of classical simulation:

1. **Exponential Scaling**: Classical simulations require resources that grow exponentially with qubit count
2. **Limited Quantum Advantage**: Some quantum algorithms that provide exponential speedup cannot be efficiently simulated
3. **Noise Models**: Real quantum computers have noise; HaskQ provides basic noise models, but these are approximations

## Best Practices for Simulation

When using the HaskQ simulator, consider these best practices:

1. **Start Small**: Begin with small circuits to validate your quantum algorithm
2. **Incremental Development**: Add complexity incrementally, validating at each step
3. **Use Visualizations**: Visualize your circuits to verify their structure
4. **Validate with Known Cases**: Test your circuits with known inputs and expected outputs
5. **Monitor Resource Usage**: Keep track of memory usage for larger simulations

## Next Steps

Now that you understand HaskQ's simulation capabilities, you can:

1. Explore the [Quantum Algorithms](../tutorials/algorithms) section to implement well-known quantum algorithms
2. Learn about [Circuit Optimization](../core-concepts/circuit-composition) techniques
3. Try the [Playground](../../playground) interface for interactive simulation

HaskQ's simulator provides a powerful tool for developing and testing quantum algorithms without a physical quantum computer, allowing you to explore quantum computing concepts and develop intuition for quantum mechanics.
