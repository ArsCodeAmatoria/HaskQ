# Advanced Quantum Algorithms

This page introduces advanced quantum algorithms and their implementation in HaskQ. These algorithms build upon the fundamental blocks like the Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) and Grover's search algorithm.

## Shor's Algorithm

Shor's algorithm is a quantum algorithm for integer factorization, providing an exponential speedup over the best-known classical algorithms. This has significant implications for cryptography, particularly for breaking RSA encryption.

### Algorithm Structure

Shor's algorithm consists of two parts:
1. **Reduction of factoring to order-finding** (can be done classically)
2. **Quantum order-finding** (where the quantum advantage comes from)

The quantum part uses:
- The Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT)
- Modular exponentiation

### Implementation Outline

```haskell
-- Pseudocode for Shor's algorithm
shorAlgorithm :: Int -> IO (Maybe (Int, Int))
shorAlgorithm n = do
  -- Choose random a < n
  a <- chooseRandom (1, n-1)
  
  -- Check if we got lucky
  let g = gcd a n
  if g > 1
    then return $ Just (g, n `div` g)
    else do
      -- Use quantum period finding
      r <- findPeriod a n
      
      -- Process the result
      if r `mod` 2 /= 0
        then shorAlgorithm n  -- Try again
        else do
          let x = a^(r `div` 2) `mod` n
          if x == n-1
            then shorAlgorithm n  -- Try again
            else do
              let factor1 = gcd (x-1) n
                  factor2 = gcd (x+1) n
              return $ Just (factor1, factor2)
```

## Quantum Phase Estimation

Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) is a quantum algorithm to estimate the phase (or eigenvalue) of an eigenvector of a unitary operator. It's a key component in many quantum algorithms, including Shor's algorithm.

### Algorithm Structure

1. Initialize a register of qubits in the |0âŸ© state
2. Apply Hadamard gates to the first register
3. Apply controlled unitary operations
4. Apply an inverse Quantum Fourier Transform
5. Measure the qubits

### Implementation Outline

```haskell
-- Pseudocode for Quantum Phase Estimation
phaseEstimation :: Int -> (Qubit %1-> Circ Qubit) -> Qubit %1-> Circ ([Qubit], Qubit)
phaseEstimation precision unitaryU eigenstate = do
  -- Create precision number of control qubits
  controlQubits <- withQubits precision (\qs -> pure qs)
  
  -- Apply Hadamard to all control qubits
  controlQubits' <- applyHadamardToAll controlQubits
  
  -- Apply controlled unitary operations
  (controlQubits'', eigenstate') <- applyControlledOperations unitaryU controlQubits' eigenstate
  
  -- Apply inverse QFT to control qubits
  transformedControls <- inverseQft controlQubits''
  
  pure (transformedControls, eigenstate')
```

## Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA)

QAOA is a quantum algorithm for finding approximate solutions to combinatorial optimization problems. It's particularly promising for near-term quantum computers with limited quantum resources.

### Algorithm Structure

1. Prepare an initial state (typically a uniform superposition)
2. Alternately apply:
   - A problem Hamiltonian
   - A mixing Hamiltonian
3. Measure and obtain a candidate solution
4. Repeat and use classical optimization to tune the parameters

### Future Implementation

HaskQ plans to include a QAOA implementation in future versions, allowing optimization for:
- Maximum Cut
- Traveling Salesman Problem
- Boolean Satisfiability

## Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE)

VQE is a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm used to estimate the ground state energy of a quantum system. It's particularly useful for quantum chemistry and materials science.

### Algorithm Structure

1. Prepare a parameterized quantum state (ansatz)
2. Measure the energy (expectation value of a Hamiltonian)
3. Use classical optimization to update the parameters
4. Repeat until convergence
