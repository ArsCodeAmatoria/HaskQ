# Hybrid Quantum-Classical Algorithms

This page explains how to implement hybrid quantum-classical algorithms in HaskQ.

## Overview

Hybrid quantum-classical algorithms combine quantum computing with classical processing to solve complex problems that neither approach could tackle efficiently alone.

## VQE (Variational Quantum Eigensolver)

```haskell
-- Coming soon
```

## QAOA (Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm)

```haskell
-- Coming soon
```
